# Long-Range Forecast Enhancements

The three-day marine pipeline now includes a machine learning forecaster that extends
predictions beyond the operational 72-hour window. The new
`src/marine_ops/pipeline/ml_forecast.py` module offers utilities to:

- Load historical CSV or SQLite datasets alongside the most recent fused frames.
- Train and cache a RandomForest regression model targeting significant wave height.
- Produce 7-day outlooks that are embedded in the HTML/JSON/CSV reports generated by
  `scripts/weather_job_3d.py`.
- Detect residual-based anomalies to highlight suspicious historical observations.

When running the `weather_job_3d.py` orchestrator, the job will train (or reuse cached)
artifacts before rendering reports. Results are rendered inside the new “7-Day Forecast
Outlook” and “Model Anomaly Alerts” sections, and auxiliary CSV payloads are stored next to
the existing outputs for downstream automation.
